## Release v1.1.0

v1.1 adds support for obtaining basic server-side statistics on individual statement executions.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Improvements

* Added `IOUsage` and `TimingInformation` struct types containing information on server-side statistics
  * IOUsage contains `long ReadIOs`
  * TimingInformation contains `long ProcessingTimeMilliseconds`
* Added `IOUsage? GetConsumedIOs()` and `TimingInformation? GetTimingInformation()` to the `IResult` interface
  * IOUsage and TimingInformation are stateful, meaning the statistics returned by the method reflect the state at the time of method execution

## Release v1.0.1

### :beetle: Bug Fixes:
* Fixed the bug which leads to infinite number of retries on expired long running transactions.
* Merged in the ION Hash fix on ION structs with multiple fields.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Improvements
* Customized exceptions in a transaction will abort the transaction immediately.

## GA Release v1.0.0

### :hammer_and_wrench: Improvements
* Added `Execute` methods that take a customized `RetryPolicy` object. It allows customer to set the retry limit and also create customized 'IBackoffStrategy'.
* Added `QldbDriverBuilder.WithRetryLogging` to enable logging retries.

### :warning: Deprecated
* The `Execute` methods in the `IQldbDriver` class that take a `retryAction` parameter are deprecated, and will be removed in the future release.

## Release the v1.0.0-rc-1
We have reworked the driver to deliver the next set of changes:

read the [release notes](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-qldb-driver-dotnet/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.1).
* Support for .NET Core

### :hammer_and_wrench: Improvements
* Improve the performance of the driver by removing unnecessary calls to QLDB.


### :warning: Removed

details please read the [release notes](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-qldb-driver-dotnet/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.1).

* `QldbSession` and `Transaction` classes are not accessible anymore. Please use
`QldbDriver` instead to execute transactions. For more details please read 
the [release notes](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-qldb-driver-dotnet/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.1).

* `QldbDriver.Execute(String)` method has been removed. Please use `QldbDriver.Execute<T>(Func<TransactionExecutor, T> func)` or 
`QldbDriver.Execute(Action<TransactionExecutor> action)` methods instead.
