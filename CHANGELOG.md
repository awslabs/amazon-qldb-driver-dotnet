## Release the v1.0.0-rc-1
We have reworked the driver to deliver the next set of changes:


* Added the `getTableNames` method to the `QldbDriver` class. For more details please
read the [release notes](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-qldb-driver-dotnet/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.1).
* Support for .NET Core

### :hammer_and_wrench:â€‹ Improvements
* Improve the performance of the driver by removing unnecessary calls to QLDB.


### :warning: Removed
* `PooledQldbDriver` has been removed in favor of the `QldbDriver`. For more
details please read the [release notes](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-qldb-driver-dotnet/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.1).

* `QldbSession` and `Transaction` classes are not accesible anymore. Please use
`QldbDriver` instead to execute transactions. For more details please read 
the [release notes](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-qldb-driver-dotnet/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.1).

* `QldbDriver.Execute(String)` method has been removed. Please use `QldbDriver.Execute<T>(Func<TransactionExecutor, T> func)` or 
`QldbDriver.Execute(Action<TransactionExecutor> action)` methods instead.
